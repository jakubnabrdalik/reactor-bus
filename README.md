Legacy Reactor Bus

This project is based on reactor 2. If you are searching for an up-to-date event bus, you need to search elsewhere.

For example take a look at [Event listener annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/event/EventListener.html) for single instance event bus, or at [Spring Cloud Stream](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/Ditmars.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/) for a distributed solution.
