Legacy Reactor Bus

This project is outdated (Reactor version 2). If you want an up-to-date solution, please look elsewhere.

For a simple event bus on a single instance, you can use [Spring Core event listeners](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#context-functionality-events-annotation)

For distributed events you might want to look at [Spring Cloud Stream](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) and use [RabbitMQ](https://projects.spring.io/spring-amqp/) or [Kafka](https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/current/reference/html/) underneath.
